"Notes for 'Age-standardised mortality rates for deaths by vaccination status, England: deaths occurring between 1 January 2021 and 31 May 2022: 6 July 2022'"				
This worksheet contains 1 table.				
Note Number	Note Text	Applies to Tables		
Note 1	"Age-standardised mortality rates per 100,000 person-years, standardised to the 2013 European Standard Population using five-year age groups from those aged 10 years and over. 'Person-years' take into account both the number of people and the amount of time spent in each vaccination status. For more information, see our methodology article."	"1,2,3,4,5"		
Note 2	"Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures based on deaths that occurred between 1 January 2021 and 31 May 2022 and were registered by 8 June 2022. These figures represent death occurrences, there can be a delay between the date a death occurred and the date a death was registered. More information can be found in our Impact of registration delays release."	"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"		
Note 3	"ASMRs are calculated using the Public Health Data Asset, a linked dataset of people resident in England, who could be linked to the 2011 Census and GP Patient Register. This dataset covers approximately 79% of the population in England aged 10+."	"1,2,3,4,5,6"		
Note 4	"Deaths were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10). Deaths involving the coronavirus (COVID-19) are defined as those with an underlying cause, or any mention of, ICD-10 codes U07.1 (COVID-19 virus identified) or U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified). Please note, this differs from the definition used in the majority of mortality outputs."	"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"		
Note 5	"95% confidence intervals are indicated by the shaded regions. Where the total number of deaths is less than 100, Dobsonâ€™s method is used, otherwise the normal approximation is used. Non-overlapping confidence intervals denote a statistically significant difference in ASMR."	"1,2,3,4,5"		
Note 6	"Rates marked with u in 'Noted as Unreliable' column are unreliable due to small numbers of deaths. Otherwise, column left blank."	"1,2,4,5"		
Note 7	x denotes data are not available; age-standardised rates are not provided for categories with fewer than 10 deaths.	"1,2,3,4,5"		
Note 8	Age is defined on the first day of the month.	"1,2,3,4,5,6"		
Note 9	"Caution must be taken when comparing mortality rates and counts as the characteristics of people in the different vaccination status groups, such as health, may differ, particularly due to the prioritisation of the vaccine to more clinically vulnerable people. While differences in the ages of people in the vaccination status groups are accounted for, other differences, such as ethnicity or level of deprivation, may remain, which can affect the mortality rates and counts."	"1,2,3,4,5,6"		
Note 10	Totals of person-years may not exactly equal the sum of totals from breakdowns due to rounding.	"1,2,3,4,5,6"		
Note 11	"Third dose and booster vaccinations are defined as a third or booster dose received after 16 September 2021, the date from which booster doses were first administered. Due to our definition of a third dose or booster only including data from 16th September, there are 0 Person-years and consequently 0 counts of death before September for 'Within 21 days of third dose or booster' and  '21 days or more after third dose or booster', and within September for '21 days or more after third dose or booster'. Spring boosters have not yet been distinguished in this analysis."	"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8"		
Note 12	'21 days or more after a second dose' is separated into '21 days or more but less than 6 months after a second dose' and '6 months or more after a second dose'.	"1,3,4,7"		
Note 13	'21 days or more but less than 6 months after a second dose' and '6 months or more after a second dose' are combined into '21 days or more after a second dose' due to low counts.	"2,5"		
Note 14	"These counts are for all deaths that have been registered, not solely those in the Public Health Data Asset which are used to calculate the mortality rates."	"7,8,9"		
Note 15	Age is defined on the date of death.	"7,8,9"		
Note 16	"When the category of 'Ever Vaccinated' is included, the total counts and person-years of those in all the vaccination categories will add up to the 'Ever Vaccinated' totals (differences in person-years may occur due to rounding)."	"1,3,4,8"		
Note 17	"There were some people who were vaccinated but not included in the NIMS data as they died soon after vaccination. Of these, 1,436 linked to our Public health Data Asset dataset. We included the latest vaccination records for these people in our dataset. This data is provisional and extends up to the 25 May 2022. This will be updated in future releases."	"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9"		
Note 18	Primary and secondary suppression are applied to counts less than 3.	"2,5,8,9"
